When input size>100000, your solution actually limited to O(N)*Log(N). If sorted (or make it sorted), think towards binary search, if not then think of sliding window or 2 pointers, prefix sum, or those algorithms worst time is O(N)*Log(N); when input size ≤ 1000, which means worst is O(N²), back-tracking is not acceptable, your direction should be DP or memorized DFS; if input size ≤ 100, actually you can either brute force or a standard permutations or combinations problem: O(N!) time.
